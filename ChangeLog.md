## 0.3.0

 * Simplified versions to 3 numbers since I won't need 4.
 * Fixed a bug in `getRelativePos`
 * Renamed `TheMiddle` to `Center`


## 0.4.0

 * Imported the KDTree library into code and edited it to make the code faster

 
## 0.5.0

 * Renamed IndexPath to PictureShape and made large changes to it
 * Also changed the internal order of pixels so y comes before x (change made because the library expects x and y reversed and it was easier to do the same)
